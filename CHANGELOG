0.1.0 (5 September 2014)
  * Update most dependencies so things should work more reliably with all the
    changes in the world since I first wrote this.
  * Uses latest version of `image_optim`, which now requires `pngquant` for
    insanity-level PNG optimization powers.
  * Drop support for Ruby 1.8.7 as it is EOL.

0.0.3 (18 March 2014)
  * fix gem install issue on 1.9.3

0.0.2 (15 March 2014)
  * redo core loop to take advantage of multi-core systems.
    - on a quick test with mislav/poignant-guide on my core-i7 system, full run
      time was reduced from ~103sec -> ~45sec.
  * better peg version dependencies to stand the test of time.

0.0.1 (30 June 2012)
  * initial release as a gem package
